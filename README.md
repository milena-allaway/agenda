# Weekly Scheduler

## Description
An agenda app to keep track of your daily schedule. As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add and save important events to a daily planner, so that I can manage my time effectivley. The day and time are displayed at the top and the day is separated into one hour blocks. The displayed time blocks are for standard business hours of 9am - 5pm. The day's event blocks are also color coded, indicating 'past, present, and future' time. 
This project was a fun one, and I learned a lot about the dayjs library. Once again, my tutor, Katie Redford, provided guidance when I was stuck, and I was able to better understand how to loop over elements, isolate an id, and parse that data into a compareable variable, all using jquery. 

## Installation
N/A no installation required

## Usage
When you visit https://milena-allaway.github.io/agenda/ you will see a page that looks likes this:
![milena-allaway github io_agenda_](https://github.com/milena-allaway/agenda/assets/132115087/f8ac6c56-1926-49e5-9f7f-94b98e726afe)


You then can input events into the text area within your prefered time block and click the save button to save them.
If you refresh the page, the saved events will still display. The day will be broken down into color coded areas of 'past, present, and future' depending on the current time.
